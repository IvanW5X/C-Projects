How to run program:
I decided to use a makefile to compile and run my files to make the process easy-to-use and efficient.
To compile my program, type "make" into the terminal for compilation of the files.
Next, type "movies <movie-data-filename>" to run the program using the data from <movie-data-filename>.
Further instructions will be given by the program in the terminal and allows for user input.
To clear the object files and executable, type "make clean" into the terminal.
